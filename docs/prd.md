# Code4all Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- To develop a working prototype of a ReAct agent application that provides LangGraph documentation assistance using MCP tools.
- To produce a high-quality, reproducible application with a Gradio UI that demonstrates ReAct agent capabilities.
- To create a tool that reduces context-switching for developers learning LangGraph by providing direct access to documentation.

### Background Context
Developers working with LangGraph often need to reference documentation while coding. This project creates a specialized assistant that provides accurate, context-aware answers directly from LangGraph documentation using a ReAct agent with MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

## Requirements

### Functional
1. FR1: ReAct Agent: The system implements a ReAct-style agent using LangGraph that can reason through documentation queries.
2. FR2: MCP Integration: The application integrates with Context7 MCP server to access LangGraph documentation tools.
3. FR3: Documentation Search: The system performs searches on the knowledge base and returns relevant answers to user queries.
4. FR4: Interactive Interface: The application provides a simple Gradio chat interface for submitting queries and displaying responses.
5. FR5: Conversational Memory: The system retains conversation state to support follow-up questions and context carryover.

### Non Functional
1. NFR1: Python Implementation: The entire application is written in Python.
2. NFR2: LangGraph Framework: The core agent logic is implemented using LangGraph's create_react_agent.
3. NFR3: Open Source Models: The solution uses Mistral's Codestral model (open-source) via langchain-mistralai.
4. NFR4: Code Quality and Reproducibility: The code is well-structured with clear setup instructions and requirements.
5. NFR5: Modular Model Design: The underlying language model can be easily swapped without architectural changes.
6. NFR6: Structured Documentation: Documentation details the architecture and implementation decisions.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The user experience is minimalist and developer-focused, providing a clean chat interface for querying LangGraph documentation.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- Simple chat-based Q&A flow using Gradio ChatInterface
- User types natural language queries about LangGraph
- Agent responds with documentation-grounded answers
- Conversation history is maintained for follow-up questions

### Core Interface
Single Gradio ChatInterface with:
- Application title: "Code4all"
- Chat input for user queries
- Response area displaying agent answers
- Example queries to guide users

## Technical Architecture

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all application code.

### Service Architecture: Monolith
Single Python application with modular components:
- Agent layer (ReAct agent implementation)
- Service layer (agent orchestration)
- RAG layer (MCP integration)
- UI layer (Gradio interface)

### Testing Requirements
Basic unit tests for core agent functionality with mock tools.

## Implementation Summary
The application implements a ReAct agent that:
- Uses LangGraph's create_react_agent with memory persistence
- Integrates with Context7 MCP server for documentation access
- Provides a Gradio chat interface
- Maintains conversation memory across interactions
- Uses Mistral Codestral model for reasoning
