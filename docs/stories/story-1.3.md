# Story 1.3: Implement the ReAct Agent

## Status
Completed

## User Story
As a developer, I want to implement a ReAct-style agent that can use a set of tools through a 'thought-action-observation' reasoning loop, so that it can autonomously solve multi-step problems.

## Context
Derived from Epic 1 in `docs/epics/epic-1.md` and PRD in `docs/prd.md`. This story builds upon the MCP client implementation from Story 1.2 to create a functional ReAct agent.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A ReAct agent is created using LangGraph.
2. The agent has a toolkit containing `documentation_search`.
3. The agent answers a complex query by using the tool.

## Deliverables
- ReAct agent implementation using LangGraph (e.g., `src/agent/agent.py`).
- Agent configuration with proper prompting for ReAct reasoning pattern.
- Integration with existing MCP client tools from Story 1.2.

## Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements
- Use open-source LLM models only (no paid APIs).
- Maintain monorepo, single-service Python implementation.
- Agent must be easily configurable and swappable (per NFR5).

## Implementation Plan (Tasks)
- Enhance `src/agent/agent.py` with proper ReAct agent implementation using LangGraph.
- Configure agent with system prompts that enforce thought-action-observation pattern.
- Integrate existing `documentation_search` tool from Story 1.2.

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria satisfied.
- Agent demonstrates clear ReAct reasoning pattern in logs.
- Complex queries are resolved using documentation_search tool.
