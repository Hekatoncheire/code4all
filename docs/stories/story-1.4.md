# Story 1.4: Integrate ReAct Agent into the Gradio UI

## Status
Planned

## User Story
As a user, I want the Gradio UI to use the ReAct agent, so that I can ask complex questions and see the agent work through the problem to provide a final answer.

## Context
Derived from Epic 1 in `docs/epics/epic-1.md` and PRD in `docs/prd.md`. This story completes the epic by integrating the ReAct agent from Story 1.3 into the Gradio interface from Story 1.1.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Gradio UI backend calls the ReAct agent.
2. The UI displays the final answer (text or code).
3. The agent's answers are displayed in the UI.

## Deliverables
- Enhanced Gradio interface with ReAct agent integration (e.g., `src/ui/interface.py`).
- Service layer connecting UI to agent (e.g., `src/service.py`).
- Complete end-to-end functionality from user query to agent response.

## Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements
- Use open-source models only (no paid APIs).
- Maintain monorepo, single-service Python implementation.
- Minimalist developer-focused UI design.
- Clear separation between UI, service, and agent layers.

## Implementation Plan (Tasks)
- Create service layer in `src/service.py` to handle agent invocation.
- Enhance `src/ui/interface.py` to integrate with ReAct agent via service layer.
- Update main entry point to launch complete integrated application.

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria satisfied.
- Users can ask complex questions through Gradio interface.
- Agent responses are displayed clearly.
- Application runs locally following README instructions.
