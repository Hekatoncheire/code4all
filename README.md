# Code4all - Autonomous, local-first coding assistant that helps developers work with LangGraph using a simple Gradio UI and an agentic workflow. Responses are grounded in documentation via an MCP client.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.x

## Setup
```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment
Copy the example file and set any required secrets:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
`.env` variables:
- `MCP_API_KEY` â€” API key for the Context7 MCP server

## Run
```bash
python3 -m main.py
```
This launches the Gradio UI (Blocks) with a textbox to ask questions and panes for answers and logs.

## Tests
```bash
pytest -q
```

## Linting & Formatting
```bash
# Format

isort .

# Lint
