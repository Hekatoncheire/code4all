# Code4all Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Goals and Background Context
### Goals
- To develop a working prototype of an Agentic RAG chatbot application that meets all core technical requirements (Python, LangGraph, RAG, no paid APIs).
- To produce a high-quality, reproducible command-line application with a Gradio UI that is well-documented and can achieve a high evaluation score.
- To create a tool that measurably reduces the time and friction for a developer learning and implementing the LangGraph framework.

### Background Context
Developers working with complex, modern frameworks like LangGraph often struggle with inefficient workflows, constantly switching between their code and external documentation. This "context-switching" slows development and increases cognitive load. This project aims to solve that problem by creating a specialized assistant that provides accurate, context-aware answers and code examples directly within the developer's environment, grounded in a reliable and up-to-date knowledge base.

## Requirements
### Functional
1. FR1: Agentic Routing: The system must analyze user queries to determine their intent and autonomously route the request to the appropriate internal agent (e.g., a search agent for definitions or a coder agent for code examples).
2. FR2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The application must implement the RAG technique, grounding its responses in an external knowledge base sourced from the LangGraph documentation.
3. FR3: Documentation Search: The system must be able to perform a semantic search on the knowledge base and return relevant, text-based answers to user queries.
4. FR4: Code Snippet Generation: The system must be able to generate relevant Python code snippets based on the context retrieved from the knowledge base.
5. FR5: Interactive Interface: The application must provide a simple, interactive user interface using Gradio for submitting queries and displaying formatted responses.
6. FR6: Workflow Transparency: The application must provide a clear output of its internal decision-making process (e.g., logging which agent is being used) to make the agentic workflow understandable during a demonstration.
7. FR7: Conversational Memory: The system must retain short-term conversation state to support follow-up questions and context carryover across turns.

### Non Functional
1. NFR1: Python Implementation: The entire application must be written in Python.
2. NFR2: LangGraph Framework: The core agentic logic must be implemented using the LangGraph framework.
3. NFR3: No-Cost Operation: The solution must not use any paid APIs. All models used must be open-source and free.
4. NFR4: Code Quality and Reproducibility: The code must be high-quality, well-structured, and easily reproducible by another developer using clear setup instructions and a requirements file.
5. NFR5: Modular Model Design: The underlying language model must be easily swappable with a different open-source model without requiring significant architectural changes.
6. NFR6: Structured Documentation: The final submission must include structured documentation detailing the architecture, design decisions, and operational logic.

## User Interface Design Goals
### Overall UX Vision
The user experience will be minimalist, functional, and developer-focused. The primary goal is to provide a clean, distraction-free interface that allows for rapid querying and clear presentation of results, including formatted code. The design should prioritize clarity and speed over aesthetic complexity.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- The core interaction will be a simple question-and-answer (Q&A) flow.
- The user types a natural language query into an input field and submits the query.
- The application displays the agent's final response in a formatted output area.
- Code snippets in the response are clearly distinguished from regular text, with syntax highlighting and a "copy" button.
- A separate, smaller area displays the agent's internal "thought process" logs for demonstration purposes.

### Core Screens and Views
As a simple Gradio application, there will be a single primary view containing these key components:
- A header with the application title (e.g., "Code4all").
- A large text input box for the user's query.
- A "Submit" button.
- A main output area to display the formatted response.
- A secondary, smaller output area for the agent's internal logs.

### Accessibility
Target: None. As a prototype, we will not target a specific WCAG compliance level. However, we will follow basic best practices, such as ensuring text is readable and the interface is usable via keyboard.

### Branding
Style: Minimal to no branding is required. A simple, clear title is sufficient. The focus is on functionality.

### Target Device and Platforms
Platforms: Web Responsive. The Gradio interface should be functional on all modern desktop web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Technical Assumptions
### Repository Structure: Monorepo
A single repository will be used to house all the code for the "Code4all" application.

Rationale: For a prototype of this scale with a tightly integrated backend and a simple Gradio UI, a monorepo simplifies dependency management and setup, enhancing reproducibility.

### Service Architecture: Monolith
The application will be built as a single, monolithic service.

Rationale: A monolithic architecture is the most straightforward approach for a self-contained prototype. It avoids the unnecessary complexity of microservices or serverless functions, allowing the focus to remain on the core agentic logic.

### Testing Requirements
The project will require critical unit tests for the most essential logic (e.g., data parsing, core agent functions). The full end-to-end agentic workflow must be manually verifiable for the demonstration. A comprehensive, automated integration test suite is not required for the MVP.

Rationale: This approach balances the need for code quality and correctness with the practical constraints of a tight deadline, ensuring the core functionality is robust while minimizing development overhead.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
The open-source embedding and language models will be sourced from Hugging Face.

The application's state and agentic graph will be managed exclusively by the LangGraph framework.

The prototype is intended to run locally and will not be deployed to a cloud environment.

## Epic List
1. Epic 1: "Code4all" ReAct Agent Implementation — Goal: Build and demonstrate a complete, tool-using ReAct agent from project setup to a functional Gradio UI, fulfilling all core project requirements in a single, streamlined workflow.

## Epic 1: "Code4all" ReAct Agent Implementation
Expanded Goal: The goal of this epic is to build the "Code4all" application from start to finish. We will establish the project scaffolding, implement the necessary tools (for search and code generation), construct a ReAct agent that can intelligently use these tools, and integrate the final agent into a Gradio UI for a complete and compelling demonstration.

- Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Environment Setup
  - User Story: As a developer, I want a well-defined project structure and a reproducible environment, so that I can start building the application efficiently and consistently.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    1. A Git repository is initialized with a standard Python project structure (e.g., src/, tests/).
    2. A requirements.txt file is created listing all initial dependencies (e.g., LangGraph, Gradio).
    3. A README.md file is created with the project title and initial setup/run instructions.
    4. A basic "hello world" Gradio application can be successfully launched from a main Python script.

- Story 1.2: MCP Client Implementation
  - User Story: As a developer, I want to implement a client that connects to the MCP server's documentation tool and wrap it for agent use, so that the system can retrieve documentation on demand.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    1. A Python function is created that successfully queries the Context7 MCP server's documentation tool/API.
    2. The function is wrapped into a LangChain Tool with a clear name (e.g., documentation_search) and a description of its purpose.
    3. A basic LangGraph agent is configured with access to this new tool.
    4. The agent can successfully invoke the tool with a test query and correctly process the documentation snippet returned by the server.

- Story 1.3: Implement the Coder Tool
  - User Story: As a developer, I want a specialized tool that can generate Python code snippets based on provided documentation context, so that the ReAct agent has a code generation capability in its toolkit.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    1. A new Python function is created that takes a query and documentation context as input and prompts an LLM to generate a relevant code snippet.
    2. The function is wrapped into a LangChain Tool with a clear name (e.g., code_generator) and a description of its purpose.
    3. The tool can be tested independently and returns a formatted code string.

- Story 1.4: Implement the ReAct Agent
  - User Story: As a developer, I want to implement a ReAct-style agent that can use a set of tools through a 'thought-action-observation' reasoning loop, so that it can autonomously solve multi-step problems.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    1. A ReAct agent is created using LangGraph.
    2. The agent is provided with a toolkit containing both the documentation_search and code_generator tools.
    3. The agent's reasoning process (Thought, Action, Observation) is clearly visible in the console logs.
    4. The agent can successfully answer a complex query by first using the documentation_search tool and then feeding that output into the code_generator tool within the same reasoning loop.

- Story 1.5: Integrate ReAct Agent into the Gradio UI
  - User Story: As a user, I want the Gradio UI to use the ReAct agent, so that I can ask complex questions and see the agent work through the problem to provide a final answer.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    1. The Gradio UI's backend logic is updated to call the ReAct agent.
    2. The UI can successfully display the final answer (either text or code) generated by the agent.
    3. The agent's intermediate steps (thoughts and tool outputs) are streamed to a logging area in the UI to provide a real-time view of its reasoning process.
