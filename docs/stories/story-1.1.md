# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Environment Setup

## User Story
As a developer, I want a well-defined project structure and a reproducible environment, so that I can start building the application efficiently and consistently.

## Context
Derived from Epic 1 in `docs/epics/epic-1.md` and PRD in `docs/prd.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A Git repository is initialized with a standard Python project structure (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`).
2. A `requirements.txt` file is created listing initial dependencies (e.g., LangGraph, Gradio).
3. A `README.md` includes project title and setup/run instructions.
4. A basic Gradio application launches from a main Python script.

## Deliverables
- Initialized repo with base structure
- `requirements.txt`
- `README.md`
- Minimal Gradio app runnable locally

## Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements
- Entirely Python-based
- No paid APIs; use open-source models
- Keep architecture monolithic (per PRD)

## Implementation Plan (Tasks)
- Create base directories: `src/`, `tests/`.
- Create and pin initial dependencies in `requirements.txt` (LangGraph, Gradio, and supporting libs).
- Add `README.md` with setup, run, and development instructions.
- Implement `main.py` running a minimal Gradio interface (title, input, submit, output area).
- Add a simple CLI entry (`python -m main` or `python main.py`).
- Verify local run and document steps in README.

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria satisfied
- Commands in README reproduce a working local demo without errors
- Lint/format checks pass (if configured)
